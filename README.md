# Introduction 
This is the interview test for a C# engineering position at ELMO.
It is comprised of 7 tasks that increase in complexity, and one or two questions related to each task.

Each task should take no more than 15 minutes to complete, and the whole excercise should take no more than 2 hours.

Detailed instructions are included in the comments for each task and question.

* Task 1-3: Basic .NET Framework and C# questions.
* Task 4: Javascript /knockout.js and C#
* Task 5: Linq/lambda
* Task 6: Data annotation and model validation 
* Task 7: Business logic and unit testing

# Build, Test and Run
On opening the solution, please do a build all to ensure that the application compiles and runs.

You can find all the tasks and questions by doing a global search for 'INTERVIEW_TODO'.

Completing the assessment:
* Please make code changes as required to complete the tasks.
* Answer the questions related to a task in a separate file. 
    * NOTE: Not all tasks have accompanying questions, and some tasks have more than one question
* Ensure that the application compiles and runs, and that unit tests pass.
* If doing the test remotely, please compress the application source and the answers together into a ZIP file, and send back to the interviewer via email.

Before the tasks are implemented, the application will compile and display a 'Bad Request: Not implemented' error on startup.

At the end of the test, the application needs to compile and run, and all tests need to pass.

The application does not have persistent data storage, and this is the topic of one of the questions. 
We do not expect this to be addressed with code code changes during the test, although there are several quick solutions to implement persistence, given time.
